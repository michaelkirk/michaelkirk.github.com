  <h2>Things I am proud of</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I currently work for <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Open Whiser Systems</a> where I lead iOS development. We build products that push the frontier of private communication.</li>
    <li>I helped start <a href="http://produce.jackpine.me/">Produce Labs</a>, a Hacker Space/Supper Club in Los Angeles' Produce District.</li>
    <li>I was an organizer and teacher at <a href="https://maptimela.github.io/">MaptimeLA</a>, a group dedicated to teaching and learning how to make maps with desktop apps, code, and occasionally crafting supplies.</li>
    <li>I taught people how to repair bicycles at <a href="http://bicyclekitchen.com/">La bicicocina</a>, a rad collectively run space in East Hollywood.</li>
    <li>I cooked literally thousands of burritos for hungry folks around LA as part of the Burrito Project. We were too legit for a website. =] But if you're interested, contact me and I can connect you.</li>
    <li>For years I've had the pleasure of working with the fine folks at <a href="http://jackpine.me/">Jackpine</a>, a group of earnest and talented developers and designers.</li>
